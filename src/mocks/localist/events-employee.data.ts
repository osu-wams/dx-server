          "What is the Oregon Employees' Charitable Fund Drive? The CFD is a campaign that consolidates charitable solicitation into a once-a-year campaign. It offers access to a wide range of charities -- over 700 of them -- and gives state and university employees control over where their donations go. The first Charitable Fund Drive was implemented by Executive Order in 1989. \n\nWhen you contribute to the Charitable Fund Drive, 100% of your donation goes to the organizations you designate. Last year's fund drive administrative costs (paid by the funds and federations - no donor or state funds used) were less than ten percent of the overall funds raised. \n\nWhen you make a payroll pledge in 2019, your donation dollars will be deducted starting with the first paycheck of 2020.\n\nFor answers to frequently asked questions, go to the Charitable Fund Drive Help page\n\nGiving is easy! Many employees find the CFD's payroll contribution method easiest and most satisfying because a small amount taken out of each check adds up to a substantial gift over the course of a year.  The fund drive has an easy online pledging system that is secure, paperless and simple to use. You don't even have to create a new login and password! The giving site has already been populated with your name and OSU ID number. \n\nWould you rather donate using cash or a check? The fund drive gladly accepts cash or checks. Click here for a 2019 paper pledge form (pdf) and follow the \"mail to\" directions at the top of the form. The 2019 giving guide (pdf) will provide you with a list of funds and federations.\n\nIs it easier for you to give with a credit card? The fund drive can charge your gift to most major credit cards and do it securely online.",
